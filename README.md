# **OpenClone**


## 1 - What's openClone

Welcome to the "OpenClone" project! This repository contains all the necessary scripts, configurations, and documentation to set up a network boot and cloning system. The primary goal of this project is to facilitate the deployment and maintenance of operating systems across multiple machines within a network, ensuring efficient and streamlined processes.
<br />
This project was developed as part of my Advanced Technician Certificate (Brevet de Technicien Sup√©rieur, BTS) program. It has allowed me to apply and expand my knowledge in operating systems, networking, and scripting. By leveraging tools like PXE, TFTP, NFS, and various Linux utilities, this project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to network-based system deployment.
<br />
Feel free to modify it according to your specific needs!
